        <h1>Quantum Studies 101</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This page is to help better visualize and access quantum computing related concepts, articles, tutorials
            and any other note that maybe be useful.
        </p>
        <h2>Opinion on Future</h2>
        <p>
            Quantum Computing is a hard field to research by the same thing it makes it great.
            The fact that is not behaving like a regular computer, the forces that govern it are so different
            and soo unique we need specialized tools to even able to contain and work with them.
            One if this tool is a quantum computer itself, isn't it an interesting catch? To build one we need one?
            Well not exactly but it is easier to explain it this way.
            I believe in the future we will and we already did find solutions that make this special computers
            much more easy to build, maintain and study. We are on the same curve as we were in the beginning when we started to
            build and study electronic computers. First they were super specialized and only a few agencies possessed it, then
            by the help of evolving and cheaper technology it started to spread and eventually became generally available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now all we have to do is wait and wait till it will be publicly available don't we?
            Well the good news is that you don't! With the power of the internet you can get access simulated and in some cases real Quantum Computers.
            I believe in the future we will see much more mainstream interest towards this kind of technology. Regardless feel free to browse around this webpage and github repo.
